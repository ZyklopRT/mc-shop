## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Docker & Docker Compose** (for containerized deployment)
- **PostgreSQL** (if running without Docker)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Option 1: Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to get MC Shop running is with Docker. This method automatically sets up the database and application.

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd mc-shop
   ```

2. **Create environment file:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit the `.env` file with your configuration:

   ```bash
   # Database (for Docker Compose)
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://mc_shop_user:mc_shop_password@postgres:5432/mc_shop_db"

   # NextAuth - Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
   AUTH_SECRET="your-auth-secret-here"

   # NextAuth URL for proper redirects (adjust for your domain in production)
   NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:5000"

   # Minecraft RCON Configuration (optional)
   MINECRAFT_RCON_HOST="your-minecraft-server-host"
   MINECRAFT_RCON_PORT=25575
   MINECRAFT_RCON_PASSWORD="your-rcon-password"
   ```

3. **Start the application:**

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

For detailed Docker setup instructions, troubleshooting, and production deployment, see [DOCKER_SETUP.md](DOCKER_SETUP.md).

### Option 2: Local Development Setup

For development or if you prefer to run without Docker:

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd mc-shop
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Set up the database:**

   ```bash
   # Make sure PostgreSQL is running locally
   # Create a database named 'mc_shop_db'

   # Run migrations
   pnpm db:migrate

   # Generate Prisma client
   pnpm postinstall
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Update the `.env` file with your local PostgreSQL connection:

   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/mc_shop_db"
   AUTH_SECRET="your-auth-secret-here"
   NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:5000"
   # Add your Minecraft RCON settings
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## üéÆ Minecraft Server Configuration

To use the full feature set, configure RCON on your Minecraft server:

1. **Enable RCON in `server.properties`:**

   ```properties
   enable-rcon=true
   rcon.port=25575
   rcon.password=your-secure-password
   ```

2. **Update your environment variables:**

   ```bash
   MINECRAFT_RCON_HOST="your-server-ip"
   MINECRAFT_RCON_PORT=25575
   MINECRAFT_RCON_PASSWORD="your-secure-password"
   ```

3. **Test the connection:**
   Visit `http://localhost:5000/test-rcon` to verify RCON connectivity.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js v5
- **UI Components:** ShadCN/UI + Radix UI
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS v4
- **Validation:** Zod schemas
- **RCON:** @minecraft-js/rcon
- **State Management:** React hooks with server actions
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript integration

### Key Architectural Principles

- **Server Actions Only:** No traditional API routes, all backend logic uses Next.js server actions
- **Zod Validation:** All data validation uses Zod schemas for type safety
- **Component-First:** ShadCN UI components for consistent design
- **Type Safety:** End-to-end TypeScript from database to UI
- **RCON Integration:** Direct Minecraft server communication for real-time features
