- **Rate limiting**: Consider implementing for production use
- **Monitoring**: Analytics track download patterns

### Scalability Planning

#### Database Performance

- **Current**: Properly indexed for current operations
- **Monitoring**: Query performance as data grows
- **Optimization**: Consider read replicas for heavy browsing

#### File Storage & Downloads

- **Current**: Local file system storage
- **Production**: Consider cloud storage (S3, etc.) for scalability
- **CDN**: Global distribution for download speed
- **Backup**: Automated backup strategy for modpack files

#### Caching Strategy

- **Current**: React Server Component caching
- **Future**: Redis for frequent queries
- **Download optimization**: Consider CDN integration
- **Static generation**: For public modpack listings
