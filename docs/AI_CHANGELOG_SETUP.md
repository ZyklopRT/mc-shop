# AI-Powered Changelog Feature

This feature uses Vercel AI SDK with OpenAI to generate intelligent summaries of modpack updates.

## Setup

### Environment Configuration

Add your OpenAI API key to your environment variables:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### Dependencies

The following packages are required (already installed):

- `ai` - Vercel AI SDK core
- `@ai-sdk/openai` - OpenAI provider for Vercel AI SDK

## Features

### Automatic AI Summary Generation

When viewing modpack changelogs, the system automatically generates:

1. **Update Focus** - What the update primarily focuses on (e.g., "Magic and Adventure", "Technology and Building")
2. **Description** - 1-2 engaging sentences describing what the update brings
3. **Categories** - Primary categories the update focuses on (Magic, Technology, Adventure, etc.)
4. **Key Highlights** - 2-4 notable additions or changes players would be excited about
5. **Impact Level** - Overall impact rating (Low, Medium, High)

### AI Analysis Categories

The AI can classify updates into these categories:

- **Magic** - Spells, wizardry, enchanting mods
- **Technology** - Machines, automation, tech mods
- **Adventure** - Dungeons, bosses, exploration
- **Exploration** - Biomes, dimensions, world generation
- **Building** - Decoration, construction, aesthetics
- **Utility** - Tools, quality of life improvements
- **Optimization** - Performance, bug fixes
- **Cosmetic** - Visual improvements, shaders
- **Gameplay** - Mechanics changes, balance
- **Performance** - Optimization mods
- **Content** - New items, blocks, features
- **Bug Fix** - Stability improvements
- **Mixed** - Diverse changes across categories

## How It Works

### For New Modpack Versions

1. User uploads a new modpack version
2. System compares with previous version to generate changelog
3. AI analyzes the added/updated/removed mods
4. AI generates intelligent summary based on mod names and changes
5. Summary is displayed alongside traditional changelog

### For New Modpacks (No Previous Version)

1. User uploads a brand new modpack
2. AI analyzes all mods in the modpack
3. AI generates comprehensive summary of what the modpack offers
4. Summary helps users understand the modpack's focus and content

### Graceful Degradation

- If OpenAI API key is not configured, the feature gracefully disables
- Traditional changelog functionality works independently
- No errors or failures if AI generation fails
- Users still see full mod-level changelog details

## UI Components

### AI Summary Section

Displays prominently in the changelog with:

- Update focus as the main heading
- Descriptive summary paragraph
- Category badges with icons
- Impact level indicator
- Key highlights as a bulleted list

### Integration

- Appears between the summary stats and detailed changes
- Uses distinct blue border to indicate AI-generated content
- Brain icon to clearly identify AI-generated sections

## Technical Implementation

### Server Actions

- `generateChangelogSummary()` - Analyzes changelog for updates
- `generateNewModpackSummary()` - Analyzes new modpacks
- AI functions return `null` if API key unavailable (graceful degradation)

### Data Types

- `AIGeneratedSummary` - Type-safe AI summary structure
- `ChangelogWithAISummary` - Extended changelog with optional AI data
- Full Zod validation for all AI-generated content

### Database Storage

- AI summaries are generated on-demand (not stored in database)
- Traditional changelog entries are still stored for fast access
- Allows for easy AI model upgrades and re-generation

## Benefits

1. **User Experience** - Quick understanding of update focus without reading mod lists
2. **Content Discovery** - Highlights exciting features users might miss
3. **Categorization** - Helps users understand what type of content is added
4. **Engagement** - More appealing presentation of modpack changes
5. **Scalability** - Works automatically for any modpack size
